    An example from the paper. There are three references with length 12, 15
    and 17. And a concise hypothesis of the length 12. The brevity penalty is 1.



    In case a hypothesis translation is shorter than the references, penalty is
    applied.



    The length of the closest reference is used to compute the penalty. If the

    penalty is applied because the hypothesis length (12) is less then the
